Arrows
======

Arrows is a little game I'm making, although currently it has no game... things.
Right now it's just an island generator with a minimap.

Controls:
	L - fullscreen mode
	O - windowed mode
	[ (left bracket) - decrease map speed
	] (right bracket) - increase map speed
	F1 - show FPS, camera speed, and current zoom level
	r - generate new map
	mouse wheel - zoom in/out
	=/- - zoom in/out
	arrow keys/wasd - move map
	There's also a minimap that appears if you move your cursor to the left side of the window, cliking on it will drag the map around

You can change the map size in the variables.py file - just be sure that the height is more than the width (or the minimap will screw up)

Note: To enable the output window, change the extension of main.pyw to main.py
